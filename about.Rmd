## About Me

My name is George Pentchev. I am 17 years old and I attend White Oaks Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario, where I will be a senior this coming year. This project was possible due to my enrollment in [Kane's Free High School Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). This project was the first fully independent project I've created using R, and I had a lot of fun learning about R and how to use R tools, such as Distill (which was used to make this website). I hope to make more Data Science projects in the future!
