I am 17 years old and I attend White Oaks Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario, where I will be a senior this coming year. This project was possible due to my enrollment in Kane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp. This project was the first fully independent project I’ve created using R, and I had a lot of fun learning about R and how to use R tools, such as Distill (which was used to make this website). I hope to make more Data Science projects in the future!\nContact Info:\nEmail: 1pentchevgeo@hdsb.ca\n\n\n\n",
